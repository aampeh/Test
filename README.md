This is a Python rendition of principal component analysis in the context of facial recognition using the Extended Yale Faces Database B which you can download [here](http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/extended-yale-face-database-b-b). Originally done in R, this was written in order to experiment with the `sklearn` library.
